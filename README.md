# Chinook Music Store
Using SQL in a digital music store database, I helped the Chinook company see how they might optimize their business practices. In this project, I wrote queries in the Chinook Database which hold information about the music store, using SQL. For this project, I assisted the marketing team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information.
